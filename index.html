    <h2>
      Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
      or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or
      resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
      Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all
      things.
    </h2>
